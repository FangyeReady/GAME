If you like these music.
I will recommend our classic and useful music category system especially for video game to you.
Since Sugiyama Koichi composed for RPG Game: "Dragon Quest".
He became a paragon to build classic category for RPG Game in japan.He sort it to eight species which are: 
[1]Opening[2]Castle[3]Village[4]Wilderness[5]Maze[6]Battle[7]Boss[8]Ending 

According to this.We improved it to be more practical.We defined they are:

[1]Village(Serene&Sad)
[2]Castle(Honor&Mighty)
[3]Maze(Restless&Mystery)
[4]Wilderness(Vast&Ethnic)
[5]Battle(Enthusiastic&Valor)
[6]Boss(Devastating&Evil)
[7]Festival(Happy&Funny)
[8]Opening&Ending(Shiny&Hopeful) 

We consider they can adapt most of RPG games.So We have prepare two theme for video game RPG music:
